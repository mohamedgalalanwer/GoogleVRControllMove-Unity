# VR Development
 create an app for Android that puts the user into a scene that they can look around by moving their device.
 
 Basically using the device as a window into a different world.
 
 Obviously the camera will be locked in position but will be able to rotate on the spot.

# ExampleCode

You can get accelerometer values from  Input.acceleration . For example:
```c#
 Vector3 vector =
     new Vector3(Input.acceleration.x, Input.acceleration.y, Input.acceleration.z);
```
# Motivation

Action Scripts virtual reality glasses specs make moves when you look forward and look at the bottom of the stand
     
     
# Installation
use the script and put in unity drag and drop to GoogleVR
